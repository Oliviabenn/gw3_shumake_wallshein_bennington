                <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
                <p>Parton has described her family as being "dirt poor" (her father paid the doctor who helped deliver her with a bag of cornmeal). She outlined her family's poverty in her early songs "Coat of Many Colors" and "In the Good Old Days (When Times Were Bad)". Parton and her family lived in their rustic, one-bedroom cabin on their small subsistence farm on Locust Ridge. Her earliest public performances were in the church, beginning at age six. At seven, she started playing a homemade guitar. When she was eight, her uncle bought her first real guitar.</p>
